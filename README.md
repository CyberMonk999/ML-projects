# ML-# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects repository!  
This repository serves as a centralized collection of various machine learning projects, covering fundamental and advanced topics, with clear explanations, code, and datasets.

## Current Projects

### 1. Linear Regression  
- Simple Linear Regression to predict sales based on TV advertising budget.  
- Multivariable Linear Regression including TV, Radio, and Newspaper budgets.  
- Model comparison, evaluation, and visualization.

Path: `/Linear_Regression/`

## How to Use This Repository

- Each project is organized in its own folder with relevant notebooks and data files.  
- Open notebooks using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or Jupyter Notebook locally.  
- Follow step-by-step instructions in each notebook to understand the concepts and code.  
- Feel free to fork or clone and modify for your own learning or experimentation.

## Future Plans

- Add more projects covering classification, clustering, neural networks, and more.  
- Enhance documentation with detailed explanations and results.  
- Include links to blog posts or videos explaining each project.

## Dataset Information

Datasets used are sourced from public repositories and are included in project folders or loaded via URL when possible.
